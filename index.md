### Welcome to the Rice Farm

I'm really passionate about desktop customization, also known as 'ricing'. 
Ricing has two parts: Form and function.  The form aspect is the part that
attracts new ricers, the pure looks. Take a look at [this rice](https://imgur.com/gallery/KD1FZ).
We see opacity levels adjusted, taskbar re-done, wallpapers with matching color schemes, and 
what it looks like to actually use.  What is often unseen to a new ricer is the function of
rice.  The desktop environment (i3 in this case) uses many keyboard shortcuts all
utilizing the meta key (or windows key) for incredible efficiency.  The music player is also can be
easily controlled with two simple keyboard shortcuts also.  The text editor (emacs) is the most
powerful text editor of all time, and here it has a custom color scheme with syntax highlighting
for specific languages.  **It's all here**, __exactly__ the way the user (me) wanted it.  Every
single detail was tinkered with until I was forced to study for finals, every config file ruined
with commented out lines that didn't work, every package I abandoned left in my bin for my
package manager to clean up later (never).  But how did it get there? Well, truthfully, it was a
lot of reading about what other people did and about what problems they had.  In this
community, the odds you're the first to have a specific problem are very slim, but sometimes
finding a solution is tricky.  This site tries to alleviate that problem.  I'm
here to take ricing step-by-step purely for your convenience.  Please enjoy.
