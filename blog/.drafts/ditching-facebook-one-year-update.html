<p>Or I guess I should say Facebook <i>proper</i> . <br>
  I got rather sick and tired of using Facebook last year.  I was depressed, working nights at Amazon, and not writing any code or working on any projects.  What was supposed to be just a Summer job didn't net me enough to come back in the Fall, so my life was in stasis for the next 4 months.  Facebook has this heinous psychological effect that makes you hate your life and is still addictive.  So one year ago, I just said "fuck it" and ditched Facebook proper.  I kept their Messenger app because I appreciate the group chat functions and that was the only way I had to connect with people from school. So I'm not perfect, but I still made an improvement. </p> <br>
  <h2> What did I lose? <h2>
    <p>Of value? Nothing. However, I will admit I lost some positive functionality I did appreciate having.  I interacted on college club pages sharing information and banter about meetings and happenings in their respective communities.  This was important to me when I was a member and officer in those groups, but being away from school made me realize I wasn't losing anything.  As far as anything else goes, that was the only "good" thing I used the platform for.  Sure I shared the odd video or posted the occasional good-life-moment pictures, but those are all things nobody needs to be able to do, so nothing of value was lost.  I also found it rediculously easy to quit, which I found surprising considering Facebook's addictive nature. </p> <br>
