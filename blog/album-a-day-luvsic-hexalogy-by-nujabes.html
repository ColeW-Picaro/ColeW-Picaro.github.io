<p>I couldn't think of an album to listen to today, so I listened to one I want everyone to know about.  The Luv(sic) Hexalogy is stellar, and there is no other word for it.  Each track invokes a unique and borderline addicting feeling that makes me want to listen to it every single day forever.  As the title suggests, this is a six part series by Japanese hip-hop artist Nujabes.  Every track features lyrics by the wonderful Shing02, who finished the album using beats from Nujabes's phone after his death in 2010.  This is a team made in hip-hop heaven.  Shing02 is an amazing lyricist, and Nujabes has timeless, versatile beats.  The main theme of the album is love, but it's not a lost romance with another person.  Shing02 is rapping about his relationship with music and the people in his music career (specifically Nujabes in part 5, which was made after his death).  The first half of the series was recorded before Nujabes's death.  In Part 1 (just titled luv(sic)), Shing02 has a more upbeat tone and attitude in the song.  As the series goes on into parts 2 and 3, he still has a positive attitude, but the lyrics become lighter.  The real turning point of the record is in part 4, which was recorded after Nujabes's death.  The beats become even more mellow and the lyrics take a wistful and mournful turn.  Parts 4 and 5 are Shing02's real tribute to Nujabes.  By part 6, Shing02's lyrics go back to being upbeat, but still light as they were in parts 2 and 3.  The series finalie comes full circle and you can really feel a big burden being lifted off of Shing02's shoulders in the lyrics.  It's almost as though he was haunted by Nujabes in a healthy, albeit stressful way.  This. Is. My. Favorite. Album. And I hope you can love it and appreciate it just as much as me.  Peace.</p>
