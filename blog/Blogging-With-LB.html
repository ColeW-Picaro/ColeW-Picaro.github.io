  Hi, I'm Cole, and I decided I wanted to start a blog so I could use emacs more. If you wanna read it fine, sure, cool, nice; also there's an RSS feed on the right, so hit that up. This blog is obviously hosted with Github pages (maybe I'll set up a webserver one day) using lb, or <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">Luke Smith's Blog Script</a>. It's kinda sick, so check it out.
